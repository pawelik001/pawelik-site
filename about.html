			So, when you visited this site, basically you are intrested, what I'm doing in free time, in what I'm intreseted in, etc. My name is Pawel, I came from Poland, and I'm 17 
			years old. I'm very close to 18yo, so here, in Poland, I'll able to start driving license, and legally buy/use alcohol and cigarettes. I'm intrested in editing graphics, 
			edit videos, for example to mine YouTube channel, or some other palces. Trough my life I have learned alot things, like:
			<p>-building custom rom's for Android devices</p>
			<p>-edit movies</p>
			<p>-edit photos/make thumbnails</p>
			<p>-and- if you watching this site- how to use HTML and CSS</p>
			<p>If you want to check mine work, head to "Work" tab, if you want to check on which im working, or some of mine photos check "Gallery"
				Just if you want to talk with me, or something, use contact to check mine YouTube channel, Telegram link, Steam for gaming etc. Also I really like to collect
				cans from energy drinks, mostly from <font color="lime">Monster Energy Drink</font> :)
